# plant-perfect-IoT
Internet of Things automation for watering plants.

Summary     

Automation of plant watering. The website allows a user to set the schedule for when a specific plant or group of plants is being watered. Users are also able to choose from a set watering schedule or dynamic watering based on soil humidity sensor data. Users are also able to view data about environment that the plant is in e.g., lux, temperature and humidity

 sensor to determine when to water the plant. The user will also be alerted when the water is running low. They will also be able to view data about environment that the plant is in e.g., lux, temperature and humidity.

MVP
The MVP will allow the user to view a local webpage where they will be able to input an amount of time into a form and on submission of the form a pump will be activated that will water a house plant for that specific amount of time. It will then return when it is finished.
